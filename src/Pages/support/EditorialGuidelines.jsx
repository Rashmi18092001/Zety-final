        <h2 className="card-title">Our Editorial Principles</h2>
        <p className="card-text">
          The following values guide our entire content creation process, from idea to publication:
        </p>
        <p className="card-text">
          <strong>Empathy:</strong> We don’t write for ourselves—we write for you. Our goal is to help every job seeker land a great job. We wouldn’t be able to achieve it without empathy and understanding of the problems our readers face at every step of their job hunt. Plus, we know how frustrating clickbait is, and that’s why we avoid sensationalism in our writing at all costs. What we give you, instead, are high-quality articles that go straight to the point. Our writing is engaging and without the fluff. We strive for a light and friendly tone—including puns and jokes whenever possible—to create a laid-back vibe that will put you at ease and help diminish the stress associated with job searching. We've all been there and done that.
        </p>
        <p className="card-text">
          <strong>Accuracy:</strong> We always choose facts over opinions. Each content piece published on Zety has been thoroughly researched to ensure it includes information based on reports and statistics coming only from the most established sources. Knowledge is power, and we want you to have it!
        </p>
        <p className="card-text">
          <strong>Authority:</strong> Zety consults internal and external HR experts to keep a finger on the pulse when it comes to hiring trends. Plus, to back up our advice, our writers rely on data only from reputable sources, such as independent research organizations, universities, and state commissions like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, World Economic Forum, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Strategic Human Resource Management, National Library of Medicine, Walden University, and Harvard Business Review.
